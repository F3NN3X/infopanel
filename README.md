## InfoPanel

This is a hardware/sensor monitoring tool that can display stats like CPU Temp, GPU Temp, FPS,... on a repositionable floating window, Similar to Aida64.  
It is also fully customizable, so you can adjust it and the style to fit your needs.  
All sesnor data is currently being read from HWiNFO, so you'll need that software running to use InfoPanel.  
There are multiple profiles available, so you can swap between them as necessary.
